## My process

### Key Features and Implementation Details

1. **Bootstrap Integration**:

   - Navigation components were used directly from Bootstrap.
   - Most styling relies on Bootstrap classes for simplicity and consistency.

2. **Responsive Design**:

   - The HTML and initial Bootstrap classes were designed for mobile-first layouts.
   - Additional classes were added to enhance layouts for larger screens.

3. **Custom Styling**:

   - A minimal amount of custom CSS in `style.css` is used for styling outside Bootstrap's scope, such as colors and font styles.

4. **Template Rendering**:

   - Mustache templates are used for rendering dynamic content.

5. **JavaScript Functionality**:

   - The Fetch API is used to load data from a locally stored JSON file.
   - Based on user-selected resources, this data is dynamically injected into templates using Mustache.js.
   - The resulting HTML is then inserted into `index.html`.

6. **Optimized Performance**:
   - All data is loaded from the server when `index.html` is initially accessed.
   - After this, everything is rendered client-side, ensuring quick and seamless website transitions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5.3
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Mustache.js](https://mustache.github.io/) - for templating

## What I learned

### Using Mustache.js for Templating

For this project, I utilized **Mustache.js** to handle HTML templating. The library was included via a CDN link in `index.html`. JavaScript is then used to dynamically set the `innerHTML` of a `<div>` element with content rendered by Mustache.js.

#### Rendering Data with Mustache.js

The following snippet demonstrates how data is rendered into a Mustache template and subsequently inserted into the DOM:

```javascript
mainText.innerHTML = Mustache.render(
  await renderTemplate('main_text'),
  dataObject
);
```

Hereâ€™s an example of the corresponding Mustache template:

```html
<h1 class="display-1 font-antonio text-uppercase mb-3" id="js__name">
  {{name}}
</h1>
<div class="font-spartan fs-6">
  {{content}}
  <div class="mt-3">Source: <a href="{{{source}}}">Wikipedia</a></div>
</div>
```

### Fetching Templates and Data

The project leverages the Fetch API to load both JSON data and Mustache template files. Below is a function that retrieves a Mustache template file as a string:

```javascript
async function renderTemplate(templateName) {
  const response = await fetch(`./${templateName}.mustache`);
  const template = await response.text();
  return template;
}
```

By combining these elements, the application dynamically renders content into the DOM, creating a responsive and modular design workflow.
